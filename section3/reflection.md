## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I really agree with Carmen's idea that what I am today is what I am today but I can always acquire new skills to be better. I will also strive to to seek out challenges and not be afraid to ask for help. Fear of failure holds me back from improving and trying to be best version of myself as a developer.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I understand that with practice, I can become better. I do practice and go over topics every day. Also, I am open to feedback and suggestions from others. I feel that feedback from others can be helpful to know which areas that I need to improve on. I really struggle a long time before I am ready to ask for help. I need to work more on when to ask for help. For a while, I was asking questions too late, spending too much time on one topic. Now, I understand to set a timer and if I'm not improving, ask my peers for help. I also need to be more accepting of error messages and that it is part of the learning process.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I think developers probably use array for list of item to select on or pick. For example, I am filling my address for an order.
When I press state, I have a list of states to use from.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array is just simply a list of items group together. It is very helpful because there is a position marker(index) associated with each item. I can retrieve an item by just knowing which position the item is in the Array.  

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is useful to do a repetitive task for many items. We use a loop in conjugation with array, when we need to do same actions to every element in array. When we just need to do a specific item many times, for example printing one message 5 times, then we don't need an array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is useful for giving you the steps to complete an action. For example, I need to prepare fruits for three plates every evening. I wash the strawberries and place five strawberries on a plate. The loop would be washing and placing five strawberries onto each plate. I need to repeat the process two more times to complete the tasks.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Can array store objects?
