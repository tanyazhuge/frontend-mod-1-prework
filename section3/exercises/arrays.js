//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[animals.length-1] = "Gorilla";
//console.log(animals) checks for correct output

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals.splice(2, 0, "Tiger");

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[3]); //Since tiger has replaced elephant in position 3 and index 2, elephant index is now at 3.


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["egg", "salmon", "chicken", "lettuce"]


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.unshift("broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.unshift("tomato") //insert beginning of array
foods.push("cabbage") //insert at end of array
foods.push("carrot")

console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift()
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Grocery App: saving the list of items that I have searched before. When I start a new search, the list of items previously
//searched are displayed.
// 2: Purchasing tickets online: filling out names, it showed a list of prefix to select from.
// 3: Purchasing ticket sonline: filling out the address section, displayed list of states to select from.


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

//Create a function called callUber with 3 parameters(percentBatteryLeft, hasCharger, chargerType)
function callUber(percentBatteryLeft, hasCharger, chargerType) {
  // If statement checks condition if percentBatteryLeft is larger or equal to 15 by using comparison operator
if (percentBatteryLeft >=15) {
  // If above statement is true, then prints the string "Phone can call an Uber"
  console.log("Phone can call Uber");
  // else if statement checks condition of must having a car charger by using logical operator
} else if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car" ){
  // If above statement is true, then prints the string "Phone can call an Uber"
  console.log("Phone can call Uber");
  // else statement for rest of scenarios not in the first two conditions
} else {
  // If above statement is true, then prints the string "Not able to call an Uber"
  console.log("Not able to call an Uber!");
}
  }
// Calling the callUber function and running it
callUber(percentBatteryLeft, hasCharger, chargerType)


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
