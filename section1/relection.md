## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I think the SuperLearner Article has some really solid advices.
I already like to read a lot but I want to start give myself short breaks and remember to take care of my body.
When I am highly focus, I tend to not take care of my body as much as I should.
I want to add to this list of having a small goal each day. When I break down a large goal with small goals, I am more
likely be on track. Small goals are manageable and help me focus on getting work done each day.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
1. String is any text inside quotes. Ex: `var pet = "cat"`
2. Number would include all numbers including negative numbers and decimals.
If the number has decimals, the number is a float.  Ex: `var petsAge = "2"`
3. Boolean can only be true or false and the variable name is written as a question.
Ex: `var isHungry = true`

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
The character to indicate comments in a JavaScript files are `//` for short comments and `/* */` for multiple line comments. The code comments are information and details for other developers to understand your code. It also can be notes for the developer to remember what he did.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is similar to a name tag sticker. It give an item a label. For example, I have a favoriteAnimal sticker and put it on a dog. Now, the favoriteAnimal is assigned to a dog. I still can takeoff the sticker from the dog and relabel(re -assign) onto cat, python, fish etc.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
I am often on the Olympics website. The three variables used are country, medalCount and medalType. The country and medalType are probably strings, medalCount is a whole number.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is joining items together and converted all into strings.  

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Concatenation is usually used by developers to create more personal and specific message.
I have a recent example with my google email. I changed my google account password
and received "The password for your Google account myemail@gmail.com was changed".
The automatic email is created by concatenating my specific email and the rest of the message.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
What is the advantage of distinguishing between numbers - (float and integer)?
