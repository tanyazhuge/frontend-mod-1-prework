## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I thought it was very helpful, it kept me focus. I did a break every 35 minutes or when I have been on the same
problem, having trouble over same things.  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I found myself to be more distracted than I thought I would be at first. I was anticipating the alarm and would glanced at my clock constantly. Once, I got used to the technique, I did notice I get more work done. Since I have some items to complete every stop.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Array stores list of items. Array can only access data by number(index of items). Object stores data into key - value pair, so we can not only access data by key(strings), we also stored a relationship of two items in key-value pairs.


1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  Array -  There is only a list of students. I believe having an array is enough to store the information.
  * List of states and their capitals
  Object-  We need to have a list of states and capitals. I need key-value pair to show the relationship more accurately.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array- There is only a list of items to pack. I believe having an array is enough to store the information.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Array-There is only a list of Instagram accounts that I follow. I believe having an array is enough to store the information.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object- We need to have a list of student names and cohorts. I need key-value pair to show the relationship more accurately.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object- We need to have a list of ingredient and amounts. I need key-value pair to show the relationship more accurately.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array- There is only a list of favorite restaurants. I believe having an array is enough to store the information.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I was thinking of passwords stored in our computer. Keys would be websites and value are passcodes that need to be stored.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Why do arrays in Object would not print my entire array but only print out array length? It prints `3` instead of `["one", "two", "three"]`.
