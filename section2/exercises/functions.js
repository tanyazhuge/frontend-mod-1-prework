//-------------------
// PART 1: Function Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: Write a function below that, when called will log "Severus Snape" to the console
function printName() {
  console.log("Severus Snape");
};

printName();
printName();
printName();
printName();
// Since the function was called 4 times, "Severus Snape" will log 4 times.


// YOU DO: Write a function named sayHello that logs to the console "Oh, Hello!"
// Then, call the function 2 times.
function sayHello(){
  console.log("Oh, Hello!");
}
sayHello();
sayHello();
//-------------------
// PART 2: Arguments and Parameters
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Write a function named greetMe that takes an argument, a String, of a name.
// The function should print out the value of the String that was passed in.
// Then, call the function 3 times, each time, passing it a different name.

function greetMe(name){
  console.log(name);
}

greetMe("Apple");
greetMe("Simone");
greetMe("Caleb");


// YOU DO: Write a function that takes in 2 numbers as arguments, Numbers, and logs their sum
// Then, call that function 3 times, each time, passing in 2 different Numbers.
function numberSum(num1, num2){
  console.log(num1+num2);
}

numberSum(3,7);
numberSum(101,92);
numberSum(123,987);



// YOU DOðŸŽˆ: Write a function that takes in two strings and prints a concatenation
// of those two strings, for example the arguments could be ("Oscar", "Ruck") and
// the end result might be "Oscar and Ruck are BFFS".  Then, call that function.

function potluckDesserts(dessert1, dessert2){
  console.log("I am in charge of bringing desserts to the potluck and will bring " + dessert1 + " and " + dessert2 + "." );
}
potluckDesserts("brownies","carot cake");


//-------------------
// PART 3: Naming is Hard
//-------------------

/*
Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough
that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
What did you name each parameter, and why?

EXPLAIN:
I name the previous function potluckDesserts because it lists what type of desserts that I would bring to potluck.
I named the parameter Dessert1 and Dessert2 because there isn't a big difference between 2 items and both are desserts.
If I was asked to bring a dessert dish and side dish then I might have changed my naming system to dessertDish
and sideDish().
