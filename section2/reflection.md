## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

There is so much fear in asking questions and especially when you started at a new place. I feel there is more pressure to show my worth to my peers and my boss. I tend to wait too long to ask my questions, but I am trying to improve. For Turing, I have been giving myself 30 min to struggle on a topic and if I make no progress then its time to ask others. The articles all showed that sometimes asking the question earlier and framing the question are all very important skills to a new developer.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

While the instructions in Section 2 was not as detailed in Section 1. I still felt that there were enough information provided by Turing on several outside resources to be comfortable with the material. For Session2, I definitely did more google searches to clarify some points and instructions. I felt that because I struggle a bit more in section 2 compared to section 1, the information was more fresh compared to Section 1.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement gives the option to execute different parts of code due to different criteria.
- Daily EXAMPLE: My new daily rule is to not eat any junk food after dinner. If the time is before dinner, I can continue my action of eating my snacks.
- Web applications EXAMPLE: I am trying to register a new account name. If the name is taken, the website would prompt me to change the name. If the name is not used, I can continue on and fill out the rest of the form.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

I add multiple conditions by adding `else if`, and `else` to an `if` statement. The program would start first with the `if` condition. If that statement equals to true, then the code executes first code block. If the first statement is false, then the second condition is evaluated until a true conditional statement is found. Once that statement is found, the code would execute corresponding code block.  

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

The logical operators `&&` is here to check that TWO conditions are found and `||` is here to check that 1 of 2 conditionals are met before running code.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

With comparison operators, what instances do we use `==` operator compare to `===` operator?
